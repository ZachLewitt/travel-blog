We started our trip with an early rise. After the stress of the wedding and jumping straight back into work the week before getting up and into the car was a real struggle but thankfully Kirsty kept me moving.

## The Gateway

We arrived at Gatwick and after going through security headed to The Gateway airport lounge. This was our first trip booking an airport lounge and we were both very impressed. 

The lounge had a help yourself buffet for cooked breakfast and continental. More importantly though the alcohol was help yourself. Being a semi funcioning alcoholic I managed to neck back 2 beers, 2 glasses of Chardonnay, and a double rum and coke. Kirsty had an orange juice...

## WestJet flight

We flew via the Canadian airline WestJet to Calgary. This was the nearest airport to our first destination Banff.

The flight took 8hrs 15mins and travelled up over Scotland, Iceland, Greenland, and then into Canada. 

Our seats were in economy but we upgraded to seats with extra legroom. This was definitely worth the money as the trip was relatively comfortable for 8 hours of sitting down.

During the flight we were given a choice of drink (no rum ðŸ˜ ) and then a meal. I had Beef and Mash and Kirsty had a Vege Lasagne. We were also brought a snack Pizza roll and drink at the end of the flight.

## Rental Car

After landing and collecting our luggage we headed to the car rental desk. We booked a car online using Canadian Affair who resell Avis rentals. We were given a Toyota RAV4 which was a sizeable SUV, although we were meant to have a Dodge Charger ðŸ¤¨ The car was pretty which was ideal considering all our luggage so I didn't complain.

As I'd been drinking Kirsty offered to drive first. After nervously exiting the car park Kirsty quickly gained her confidence, which was a nice change from our US trip where she drove 30 mile an hour down a 4 lane freeway in Phoenix.

## Rocky Mountain Resort Banff

We reached our hotel in Banff and checked in. We were staying at the Rocky Mountain Resort. The hotel is on the outskirts of Banff but has a shuttle bus which runs regularly making it easy enough to get into the town.

We had the Queen Double room which was a nice sized room with two double beds (which apparently isnt romantic on a honeymoon).

## Dinner in Banff

After dropping our bags off we headed for a drink in the hotel bar and then caught the shuttle into Banff.

We were both very impressed by Banff. It feels very much like a European ski resort town. We had expected the town to be a lot smaller but were surprised by the number of bars, restaurants, and shops. Being the height of summer the streets were packed with toursists like us making it tricky to navigate.

We stopped for a quick dinner at Tommys Neighborhood Pub. I had a Roast Beef Dip sandwich which was amazing and Kirsty had the worlds largest plate of Nacho's.

## Walk Home

Both absolutely knackered at this point from the meal and 20 hour day we decided to head back. Unfortunately the shuttle didn't arrive for another hour so we decided to walk back to the hotel. 

The walk was back down the main road Banff Avenue however the actual trip seems a lot shorter in the car. It must've took about hour and a half to get back but the walk was much needed to walk off the food and the scenery made it enjoyable.

When we got back we immediately fell asleep beat from the day.
