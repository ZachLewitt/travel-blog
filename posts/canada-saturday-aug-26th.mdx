## Tofino

We got up and headed down to the hotel coffee shop to grab morning drinks and explore the hotel. We walked through the woods to the hotel boardwalk looking out over the Tofino Inlet. 

After finishing our coffees we got in the car and headed out for the day. Our first stop was Mackenzie Beach. The surf here didn't look great so we decided to head on. We did however clock an interesting looking BBQ joint.

We headed into Tofino town and had a walk around the shops. It was a little town by the waterside that was very nice and quaint. Coming from a seaside town we were relatively unimpressed but it was still a nice place. More impressive was the views of the mountain islands in the background. We ate lunch at a park overlooking the lake and watched a few water planes land and take off.

After lunch we went to a few beaches to check out the surf. We stopped at Cox Bay and Long Beach which both looked great for surfing.

## Ucluelet

We then headed down to Ucluelet to explore. We drove through the town and stopped at the lighthouse at the end of the road. We drove around the town before heading back to our hotel in Tofino.

## Dinner Disaster

We got ready for dinner and caught the shuttle to Lil Ronnie's Beachside BBQ. The shuttle didn't go all the way up to the restaurant so we had to walk around a kilometre down a dirt road to get there. Unfortunately for us the restaurant was fully booked due to a wedding so we ended up having to walk all the way back up the road. 

Kirsty was pretty miffed off so we decided to go to Tacofinos which was a Taco stall everyone raved about. We walked there and unfortunately for us again it had just closed. Instead we went to the Wildside Grill. The food here was really good and also quick. I had the Baja Burger, the waiter corrected my pronunciation and therefore forfeit his tip. Kirsty had a Veggie Ciabatta that looked pretty good too.

After dinner we walked back to the hotel and had drinks by the firepit. I was furious because it cost us Â£17 for two drinks and in the end Kirsty transferred me the money to shut me up.
