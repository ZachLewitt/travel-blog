## Wildfires

The wildfire smoke was still pretty thick in the morning. The air quality index was also showing the air outside was very unhealthy and the advise was to avoid any outdoor exercise.

We decided to spend the day wandering the streets of Revelstoke instead of attempting any massive hikes, not that the fire smoke would do much more damage than 10 years of smoking. 

We wandered around the stores and then headed down to the train museum. As it was $14pp and neither of us gave a damn about trains we turned around. We figured save the $14 for drinks.

## Chubby Funsters

We headed into the main street and stopped at a bar named Chubby Funsters. This was our admin stop, I handed Kirsty the iPad and we rearranged our holiday to avoid more interior BC stops that we could no longer visit due to the wildfires. To drink I had the Hit the Deck Hazy IPA followed by a What the Huck (IPA?). Kirsty had a (insert Kirsty). 

## The Village Idiot Bar and Grill

After a while we started to feel hungry. Our lunch stop ended up being The Village Idiot Bar and Grill. Here we shared Perogies and Poutines. Both were really nice but my takeaway, being uncultured, was that Poutine are basically chips, cheese and gravy and Perogies are just potato dumplings.

## Craft Bierhaus

Our next stop after lunch was the Craft Bierhaus. I had high hopes for a German themed bar with mega steinies. Unfortunately not but the beer was good enough anyway. We sat on the beer keg seat before it started to piss it down.

## River City Pub and Patio

Pretty tipsy at this point we went for one more stop. We ended up at the River City Pub and Patio. Full from beer at this point we went for cocktails. I had a Moscow Mule followed by a Margarita. The Moscow Mule wasn't so good (I imagine an intentional stab at Russia) but the Margarita was on form. Kirsty had (insert here).

Eventually we decided we were sufficiently liquored up and it was time to call it a night.
