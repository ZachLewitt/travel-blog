## Tacofinos

We checked out of Hotel Zed and headed to Tacofinos for Brunch. It was 11 o'clock and the queue was already massive. We queued for over an hour and finally got our food. 

I went for a Crispy Chicken Taco and grabbed a Beef Burrito for later. Kirsty had a Yam Taco after we discovered Yams are the American word for sweet potato. The Tacos were both delicious, Kirsty agreed it was worth queuing for.

## Wild Pacific Trail

We headed to the Wild Pacific Trail to do our last hike of the holiday. We stopped by the middle section of the trail and hiked from the end of the Ancient Cedars Trail to the end of Brown's Beach. The walk took us through the forest on the coast line with lots of viewpoints over the rocks and out to sea. The views were great but the weather wasn't great.

After the walk we got in the car and headed off to Nanaimo. We got stuck at the Cameron Lake roadworks. This time we got through much quicker, we ended up waiting for an hour and a half which was much better than half a day like before.

Eventually we got to Nanaimo and checked into the Days Inn for the evening.
