## Canmore

After a long sleep in to shake off the jet lag from the day before, we took the car and headed into Canmore.

Canmore is the neighbouring town to Banff and has much more of a typical American town feel in comparison to the Banff. We went to the Safeway superstore which seemed to be the biggest shop nearby for supplies.

After the supermarket we took a spin through the town centre which looked very nice and we made a mental note to come back.

## Stanley Glacier Trail

We dropped off our supplies and then headed off across Banff to our first hike of the holiday.

The Stanley Glacier Trail actually sits in Kootenay National Park right next to the border with Banff. You actually cross from Alberta into British Columbia on the journey.

The length of the walk is 4.2km and goes up an elevation of 365m. The first half of the walk takes you up through fairly dense woodlands. Along the way there is a river which the trail runs close to and crosses at one point.

The woodland thins out in the second half of the walk until you eventually come to a clearing. From here you can see the valley walls and Glacier at the peak. There are also several waterfall running down the valley walls.

We continued up the not so trodden gravel path towards the right hand side valley walls. At the top you reach the bottom of the waterfalls. Kirsty ran in for a photo before realising how cold the water actually was.

Eventually we proceeded back down the trail which was a lot easier the other way.

## Vista Lake

We only briefly stopped at Vista Lake on our way back to Banff as we were both exhausted from then previous trail. From the viewpoint overlooking the lake we managed to get a few photos.

## Canadian Brewhouse

After freshening up we caught the shuttle into Banff for dinner.

We stopped in at the Canadian Brewhouse. The Brewhouse is a sports bar right in the centre of Banff. The restaurant is on the second floor and they have balcony seating looking out over the street. Unfortunately these seats were all reserved.

For dinner I had a Buffalo Chicken Wrap and a Stella Artois (which didnt taste like Stella in the UK) and Kirsty had Buffalo Cauliflower Wings.

After dinner we were ready to pass out so we headed back to the hotel.
