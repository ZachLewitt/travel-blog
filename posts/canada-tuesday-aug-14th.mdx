## Lake Louise 

We got up early to make the 8 o'clock slot at the Lake Louise park and ride. Kirstys LinkedIn had been hacked so she was frantically trying to sort it out.

Eventually we got ready and drove to Lake Louise. When we arrived at Lake Louise we jumped in a shuttle bus and headed down to the lake. The lake and back drop are a jaw dropping sight. The lake itself is bright blue and is surrounded by snowy peaked mountains. Overlooking the lake is the Fairmont hotel, a giant hotel complex.

The lake was empty when we arrived which meant we could get some good photos before the canoes swarmed the lake. We walked part of the way round and then headed for the queue for the canoes.

There was a long wait for the canoes. People staying at the hotel could bypass the queue and jump straight on the canoes which made the day visitor queue a lot slower. Eventually we reached the front of the queue and paid $165 for an hour on the canoes. There was the option to pay $155 for 30 mins but that isn't long enough to reach the other side of the lake.

We boarded the canoes and powered off down the lake. The views were stunning and we got down the lake in a surprisingly short time. We stopped at the far end and had a sandwich and then slowly paddled back. Kirsty had given up at this point which made the way back a lot slower. We disembarked and then headed to Fairmont hotel gift shop.

## Moraine Lake

After the gift shop we hopped on the shuttle to Moraine Lake. Moraine Lake was also a very impressive lake surrounded by a mountain backdrop. This lake was a lot quieter than Lake Louise so we decided to walk around and then stopped for some lunch on the shore. We then decided we were all laked out so caught the shuttle and then drove back to Banff.

## Drinks and Dinner in Banff

We caught the 4 o'clock bus into Banff town and headed to Anejos restaurant for happy hour. The bar does $6 margaritas during happy hour so me and Kirsty chugged back a few each. I had Mango, Guava, and Ginger. The ginger had grasshopper salt on the rim which tasted as pleasant as it sounds. Kirsty had Strawberry and Rhubarb, Blood Orange, and Coconut Chilli.

After happy hour ended we wandered around before going for dinner at the Irish bar St James Gate. I had a Beef Dip sandwich and Kirsty had a Cheese Toasty. The beef dip was the best so far!
