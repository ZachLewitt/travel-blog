# The Drive

This was a fairly uneventful day. We left our hotel and hit the road. We followed Highway 1 out of Vancouver and pretty much the entire way to Canmore. We switched driving at 2 and a half hour intervals to keep sane.

Our only hiccup in the trip was that a sinkhole had opened up in the highway just outside of Banff which had reduced the road to a single lane. This meant the road was heavily backed up. 

In total the drive took us just over 12 hours.

## Lamplighters Basecamp Motel

We checked in at 10:30 to the Lamplighters Basecamp Motel. This was probably our worst room but the location was ideal. The motel was right in the centre of downtown which made it perfect for getting out and about. However the room stank of dog and the walls were incredibly thing and we could hear everyone banging around.
