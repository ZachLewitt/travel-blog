## Whistler Train Wreck

We had a slow get up after the day before. We started out by heading to the Whistler Train Wreck. The wreck is on the outskirts of the town so we had to take the car. 

There was a very short hike from the car along a trail to the first point on the hike, The Suspension Bridge. The bridge took us over the top of a fast running river and as we walked shook and bounced. I was busy trying to take photos as we walked and nearly toppled a few times. 

After the bridge we arrived at the wreck. There are 7 carriages at the wreck which was caused by a train speeding to make up for lost time and then hitting a sharp bend too fast. All of the carriages have been tagged with interesting graffiti. We walked around and grabbed a few photos. 

Kirsty was disappointed because one of the carriages had a ladder that you could use to climb onto the top of the carriage. Unfortunately there were kids on top so Kirsty wouldn't climb up and play.

After the wreck we headed back. Near the start of the trail was a path heading down to the river. We followed it down and were met with a very impressive view of the river bending round and turning into falls.

## The Lost Lake

We got in the car and headed back to the hotel to park up for the day. Our next destination was The Lost Lake which was pretty close to our hotel. We walked the trail through town before we reached the lake.

We stopped for lunch on a bench looking out over the lake. Our lunchtime entertainment was a guy and his girlfriend. The guy wanted his girlfriend to film him posing, then running along the shoreline, posing a different way, running some more, and then posing again. Whatever the girl was doing was completely wrong according to the guy and he kept doing retake after retake while delivering very critical advice to the girl. At this point everyone on the lake was watching the guy. He kept getting irate whenever anyone else came onto the beach and ruined his precious shot, totally forgetting it wasn't his beach. He must've gone through at least 500 different karate poses before we realised he was not stopping and that we should get on with our day. We walked to the otherside of the lake and I could still see him attempting the poses.

We continued our walk through the woods towards Green Lake (a pretty green lake) before looping back down the main road towards the town. 

## Happy Hour and Dinner in Whistler

When we reached the town we decided to stop in at a few bars for happy hour.

Our first stop was the Longhorn Saloon. I had a Lager and Kirsty had a wine. The drinks here were ridiculously overpriced and it cost about Â£10 a drink.

Our next stop was The Raven Room in Pan Pacific Hotel. Drinks here were much more affordable in the happy hour, although my lager wasn't the best.

We headed back to the hotel on the free park shuttle and got ready for dinner.

For dinner we decided to go to The Keg Steakhouse. Unfortunately there was no room in the main restaurant so we were seated in the bar area. The food and drinks here were very nice. I had The Keg Burger and Kirsty had the Veggie Meatloaf. Kirsty said this was the best meal she had had so far this holiday.

After dinner we were tired so we decided to head back to the hotel.
