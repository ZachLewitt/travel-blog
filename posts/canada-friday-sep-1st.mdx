## Downtown Canmore

Desperate to get away from the dog smell in our hotel room we got up and headed into downtown Canmore. 

Our first stop was at the Ken Hoen Gallery where we enquired about a piece they had in called Step Into Your Dream, which Ken the artist, has taken of Lake Louise. We loved the picture so much that we bought it when we arrived home.

## Rocky Mountain Bagel Company Again!

We then went back to the Rocky Mountain Bagel company as Kirsty was craving the bagels we had previously. This time I had The Original bagel which was delicious and Kirsty had the Veggie option she had previously.

## Grassi Lakes Trail

We did the last bit of gift shopping then decided to go for a hike. We drove and parked at the trailhead for the Grassi Lakes trail. 

The trail took us up the mountainside and across a series of small waterfalls that were running down the side of the mountain. We eventually reached a viewpoint that looked out over a large waterfall that was coming off of one of the lakes at the top of the mountain.

We clambered further up the hill until we eventually reached the lakes. The lakes were an incredibly bright blue colour with a green rim around the outside. We wandered around the lakes grabbing photos before heading back down.

## Grizzly Paw Brewing Company

We got cleaned up at the hotel then headed out for dinner. Our first stop of the evening was for drinks at the Grizzly Paw Brewing company. We sat on the patio outside and got some great photos of Kirsty who sat perfectly centre in front of a church in the background.

## The Drake Pub

We then headed for food at The Drake Pub. The food here was awful and I had the worst roast beef dip of the holiday. The setting on the patio was the saving grace and we got to enjoy some live music from a local musician.

## 1890 Smokehouse

After dinner we headed back into downtown and went for drinks at the 1890 Smokehouse. They also had live music playing. The guy playing kept doing trumpet noises as he was lacking a trumpet player which was funny to watch.

## Where The Buffalo Roam Saloon

Once the music stopped we headed to find the next bar. We stopped in at a bar called Where The Buffalo Roam Saloon. We ordered cocktails, I had a Night Owl which was their take on an Espresso Martini and it was very nice. Kirsty had the Bramble Rose which came in a tea cup with a giant ice cube in the middle. I thought it tasted quite nice but Kirsty wasn't as impressed.

## The Rose and Crown

We then headed for a final drink of the night at The Rose and Crown. This pub was very busy and had live music playing. This was clearly where all the nightlife in town went. We enjoyed the music and drinks before heading back to the hotel for the night.
