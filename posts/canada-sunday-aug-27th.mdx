## Chesterman Beach

We woke up early and rented a surfboard and bodyboard from the hotel. We loaded up the car and drove to Chesterman beach which had the biggest waves for the time of day.

When we got there I ran straight in. The water was freezing. I was surprised to see Kirsty follow me and not immediately drop out. 

I tried a couple of small waves and managed to get up on the board pretty quickly. Kirsty enjoyed herself on the bodyboard and had no problem catching the waves in (although there is no challenge in bodyboarding). 

Kirsty went and grabbed the phone and started filming me surfing. Conveniently she only caught videos of me falling off and one where I caught a baby wave. She later made a TikTok montage of all my wipeouts.

We stopped for lunch and did a bit of sunbathing. I went back into the sea and had a go on the bodyboard. It was nowhere near as fun as surfing, far too easy!

## Lil Ronnie's Beachside BBQ

Exhausted from the surf we headed back to the hotel and got ready for dinner. We ended up at Lil Ronnie's Beachside BBQ. There was a live singer playing who was really good. For dinner I had the BBQ Ribs and Kirsty had the Vegan Hotdog. We also shared a Mac and cheese. The food was amazing.

After dinner we headed back to the hotel for an early night.
