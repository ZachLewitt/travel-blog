## The Town

We headed for breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast hall was packed and we had definitely picked the busiest time of the morning. We grabbed a bite and some coffee then headed into Jasper.

Jasper town feels smaller in comparison to Banff but the crowds are a lot fewer in number. It is actually possible to navigate the streets without having to weave round family after family. 

The town sits in a valley with an amazing mountain backdrop. There is a train station in the centre of town and a train line runs parallel to the main street. It is interesting to watch carriage after carriage roll into the station.

The bulk of the shops are spread over two main streets. We spent the morning walking around the shops.

## Montanas BBQ and Bar

We stopped at Montana's BBQ and Bar for lunch. I had the Pork Ribs with Texas BBQ sauce and Popas Lemonade, both were amazing. Kirsty had the Vege burger which she said was delicious.

## Whistle Stop Pub

After lunch we went to the Whistle Stop Pub for a drink. This pub has a lodge feel mixed with bar vibes. I had a Pilsner and Kirsty had a coffee.

## Maligne Lake 

After drinks we decided to drive to Maligne Lake. En-route we saw an elk by the side of the road trying to scratch an itch on a tree.

At Maligne Lake we did a brief walk to the viewpoint of the lake. Unfortunately with the weather it was too cloudy to see much. There were red chairs at the viewpoint which were drenched. I bravely sat down and got a wet arse in order to get a decent photo.

We decided at this point with the weather to drive back to Hinton and call it a day.
