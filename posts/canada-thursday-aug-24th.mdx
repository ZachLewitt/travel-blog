## Start of the Trail

We decided our final day in Whistler would be spent hiking up one of the mountains to say we had achieved a serious hike. We picked the ascent trail on Blackcomb mountain.

The Ascent Trail starts at the bottom of Blackcomb mountain at the Upper Village. The trail follows the Blackcomb gondola up to the Rendezvous Lodge on the top of the mountain. The trail is split into 3 sections Little Burn at the bottom, then Big Burn, and finally Heart Burn. Each section of the trail follows the Gondola but weaves through the forests on the mountain.

We missed the Little Burn part of the trail on the way up, we instead walked up the dirt path to the left of the gondolas before cutting across and onto the bottom of Big Burn.

## Big Burn Trail

Big Burn starts in the woods and as we progressed the path changed from a well defined gravel path to more of a rocky clamber. We briefly left the woods to climb up a gravel incline where the ski slopes would normally be, before returning to more woods.

We eventually completed this portion of the trail. At the top was a sign from Helly Hansen offering a 25% discount if you take a selfie with it. We took a photo even though we had no intention of shopping there (it probably just removed the tourist tax they added on).

## Heart Burn Trail

Next we were onto the Heart Burn trail. This part of the trail was through woodland but the trees were much more sparse and felt a lot older. The trail was also a lot steeper here so we really started to feel the burn.

Nearly halfway up Kirsty had had enough and wanted to stop for lunch. We stopped on a secluded bench in the woods and had lunch. 

After eating we walked on for another 100 metres we reached a clearing and were met with an amazing view out over the valley. There was also an empty bench which would've been the ideal spot to eat lunchâ€¦. If Kirsty could've held on.

In one of the forest we walked through was a castle play area with slides that led to a 6 foot drop. We were slightly confused because it looked like a pretty painful fall.

The last kilometre was really painful. The trail became really steep and it took a serious push to get through it. When we reached the top Kirsty wanted to stop again even though we were only 100 metres away from the opening to the top of the mountain. There was another H&H poster here for 30% this time.

## Top of Blackcomb

The view at the top was amazing and we could see right out into the valley. At the top of the peak were the Gondola terminals and the Rendezvous Lodge. We got a few photos and then headed into the Lodge for a drink.

After a rest and drink it was time to head back down. The way down was a lot easier although we had to go slowly because the trail was intended for an uphill climb (there were actually signs advising against going the other way).

Eventually we reached the bottom of the mountain, detouring through Little Burn which we missed on the way up. 

We celebrated by popping to the Liquor Store and grabbing some wine before heading back to the hotel and jumping in the hot tub.

## Avalanche Pizza

Too tired to go out for dinner we decided to order from Avalanche Pizza. We had the half and half extra large pizza. The size was insane, we both managed about 2 slices and were done. Safe to say we quickly fell asleep after.
