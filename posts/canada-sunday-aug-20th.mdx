## Hinton Beaver Boardwalk

We got up and said goodbye to our hotel BCMInns Hinton.

Our first stop of the day was the Beaver Boardwalk in Hinton. Here we wandered around the boardwalk above a lake attempting to spot any beaver. Unfortunately we didn't manage to see any, probably due to it being late morning.

## Goodbye Jasper

We then headed into Jasper Park. We stopped at Jasper Lake and captured some photos. This lake sits against a mountain backdrop close to the outskirts of the park.

Just across from the lake was the emerald pond. This is a bright green lake, which Kirsty had named Zach Lake as we had been driving past for the last few days and made excuses for not stopping in at. Next to the lake was a small waterfall which was caked full of Sulphur. Kirsty noted the smell of eggs was pretty full on.

## Drive to Revelstoke

We then continued on our journey towards our next destination Revelstoke. The route took as back down the Icefields Parkway. Unfortunately for us the wildfires in British Columbia had caused a the air to become very smokey which was pretty much blocking all visibility of the mountains. This meant it was next to pointless stopping off at any of the viewpoints on the way down.

We managed to find a stop halfway down with some of the scenic red chairs and stop for lunch.

Eventually we reached the end of the Icefield Parkway and started to drive down highway 1 towards Revelstoke. At this point the smoke had become incredibly thick. We were starting to get nervous at this point. Without a signal we couldn't find out what the situation in Revelstoke was. We decided to take a punt and drive to Revelstoke anyway and turn back if we couldn't check in. 

## Grizz Hotel, Revelstoke

We reached the hotel, thankfully Revelstoke was fine. The smoke was a lot thicker here but the town was still functioning. We checked into our hotel The Grizz and then went for a walk around town. We saw some live music in the square and then headed to our hotel restaurant Wingin It for some spicy hot wings. I had Mach 3 and BBQ boneless wings and Kirsty had Mach 2 and Maple cauliflower wings.
