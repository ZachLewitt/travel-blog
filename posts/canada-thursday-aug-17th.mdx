## The Road

We started the day by waving goodbye to our hotel and Banff. We set off down highway 1 towards the Icefields Parkway.

As we came onto the Icefields Parkway we passed through a checkpoint that turns into a double lane road.

## Crowfoot Glacier

Our first stop on the parkway was crowfoot glacier. This is a pull over on the side of the road with a view of a massive glacier sitting on the sides of the mountain.

## Bow Lake

The next stop was Bow Lake. We pulled over in a packed layby overlooking the lake and grabbed a few photos. We then headed down the road a few hundred metres and found parking for Bow Glacier. This stop had much better views of the lake and the Glacier in the background, it was also a lot less busy.

## Peyto Lake

We headed onto the next stop, Peyto lake. There was a bit of an uphill walk from the car park to the viewpoint and a lot of unprepared people seemed to be struggling. The views from the viewpoint were worth it though.

## Howse Pass 

Hungry at this point we decided to stop at Saskatchewan River Crossing to pick up some insanely overpriced water and then parked up at Howse Pass. We sat on the benches overlooking the view here and ate lunch. 

## Mistaya Canyon 

After lunch we drove back on ourselves to a stop we missed Mistaya Canyon. We walked the short path down from the car park down to the canyon. There is a fast running river here which turns into a waterfall which wraps around the canyon.

## Coleman Creek

Our next stop was Coleman Creek. This was a relatively unimpressive creek and we only stopped briefly then carried on.

## Icefields Centre

We somehow missed the Weeping Wall and Big Bend viewpoint but made a note to go back on our way back down from Jasper. Instead we ended up at the Icefields Centre. This seemed mainly for people wanting to sign up for the skywalk. There was also a Starbucks.

## Athabasca Glacier

Across the road was the Athabasca Glacier. We parked up and walked to the mouth of the Glacier. It was incredible to be this close to a Glacier as we were used to staring at them on the mountain tops in the distance. There was an icy breeze coming off of the Glacier and Kirsty quickly got the chills.

## Sunwapta Falls 

From the Glacier we headed to Sunwapta Falls. The falls here were right next to the car park and were not as crowded as some of the other stops. We also saw a squirrel chowing down on some nuts.

## Goats and Glaciers 

Our penultimate stop was a stop called Goats and Glaciers. We saw some glaciers in the mountain range but unfortunately no goats.

## Athabasca Falls 

The final stop was Athabasca Falls. This was a massive waterfall falling through a canyon. They have a viewpoint which gets splashed by the falls, me and Kirsty stupidly stood there and got absolutely soaked.

## BCMInns Hinton

We had run out of time for the day so drove on through Jasper to Hinton. Our hotel for the next few days was BCMInns Hinton. The hotel was very nice, a little dated but much better than a motel and it had all the amenities including a swimming pool slide!!
