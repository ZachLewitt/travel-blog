## Goodbye Canmore and Policeman's Creek Boardwalk

I woke up with a hangover from the night before. This was my first serious hangover of the holiday.

Sadly we had to pack for our flight home. Reluctantly we did and then headed into the town for breakfast and the last bits of shopping.

We then did a last walk along the Policeman's Creek boardwalk. This was a short walk along a lake in the centre of town.

## Airport and Chillis

After the walk we got in the car and headed to the airport. On the way we managed to hand off our bear spray at a gas station to a pleased local.

When we got to the airport we said goodbye to our car and headed through customs. We stopped to get good and liquored up at Chillis before the flight. Unfortunately because of the table service I couldn't get to my usual level of drunkness before the flight.

Eventually our flight was ready so we said goodbye to Canada and boarded.
