## Ferry to Nanaimo

We got up to try and catch the early morning ferry from Horseshoe Bay to Nanaimo. We hadn't been able to reserve the ferry as we had to shuffle around the dates because of the wildfires and were unable to rebook.

Luckily we arrived at the terminal on time and were one of the last cars to make it through. 

We boarded the ferry and went up to the passenger desk. The queue for the restaurant was massive so we grabbed a coffee and explored the deck. There were good views from the top deck of Vancouver Island as we approached. 

Eventually we reached the island and disembarked. The ferry workers guiding the traffic were having a scrap about which lane should exit first which made the whole thing more confusing.

## Stuck at Cameron Lake

When we got off the boat we headed down the highway towards Tofino. There were roadworks on Highway 4 which had changed the road to a single lane to allow the workers to fix the road. This meant we had to be at the roadworks for 11:30 in order to get through the lights before they closed the road.

We managed to make it to the end of the queue for bang on 11:30. Phew we thought. We waited around for 45 mins before the traffic started moving. We followed the queue down the round for 10 mins or so before we came to the beginning of the single lane section. As we were approaching the barrier, 7 cars came down from ours. They had decided to stop letting cars through early and we would have to wait until 5.

We were incredibly frustrated but after taking in our surroundings we relaxed. Luckily the traffic had stopped right by Cameron Lake. We took a towel and some wine and went and chilled out on the beach. 

Finally 5 came around. We got back in the car and turned on the engine. There was still no movement. It got to 5:30 and we turned the engine off. They had decided to hold traffic until 6 so we had to wake around even longer. Kirsty was enjoying listening in on a domestic happening in the car in front so she was well entertained. 

We started moving finally! We passed the part of the road that had been wrecked by the cliff fall. It did look royally screwed. When we got to the otherside of the single lane section we saw the queue to come the other way and it was massive. Kirsty filmed as we drove past and the video lasted for 11 mins before we reached the end of the queue. There were some cheers and some people looking incredibly fucked off.

We stopped at the Walmart in Port Alberni to pick up supplies and then went for dinner at the local A&W restaurant. It was typical fast food burgers but they had an amazing Root Beer which was delicious.

## Hotel Zed, Tofino

After dinner we drove to our hotel in Tofino. We were staying at Hotel Zed which was a very nice hotel. The hotel had a hipster modern feel to it with lots of quirky extras. Amongst the standard amenities the hotel had a palm reading room, a games room that was hidden behind a bookcase that you had to crack the puzzle to open, a campervan built from wooden logs, and a coffee shop.

Knackered from the day we crashed out.
