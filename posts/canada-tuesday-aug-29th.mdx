## Ferry to Horseshoe Bay

We had a lucky start to the day by somehow managing to get the second from last stop on the 8.15 car ferry back from Vancouver Island.

When we arrived at Horseshoe Bay the weather was pretty naff and raining. We drove into Vancouver with heavy rain beating down. Our SatNav failed as well so Kirsty had to read the map to route us there. 

## The Sutton Place Hotel

After a couple of missed turns we eventually made it to our hotel The Sutton Place Hotel.

The Sutton Place is a grand hotel in the centre of downtown Vancouver. It was the perfect location to get out and explore downtown.

## Earls Bar and Gastown

We were too early to check in so we decided to go for a walk and a drink. It was raining so we popped into a nearby Earls bar and had a drink. We then headed to Granville Street and then onto Gastown. We wandered past the Steam Clock before popping in for food at The Blarney Stone for food. I had a pint of Guinness and an Irish breakfast and Kirsty had a Pretzel and Pepsi.

After lunch we went back to the hotel and chilled out. 

## The Cactus Club Cafe

We went for dinner at The Cactus Club Cafe. The food here was brilliant. I had a Thai Green Curry and Kirsty had a Veggie bowl. I had a margarita to drink and Kirsty had wine. Full from dinner we headed back for the evening.
