## Hotel Pool and DQ

We enjoyed a lie in at the hotel before heading to the hotel pool. The pool was quiet at this time of the day. The pool area had a large pool and then a hot tub. We baked in the hot tub before jumping in the pool to cool off.

After the swim we got ready and headed off for the day. We walked to the local Avis office to ask about the maintenance indicator on the car and the headed onto DQ to grab some ice creams.

I had a Reese's Ice Cream and Kirsty had the Pumpernickel flavour. They were tricky to walk and eat and I managed to spill mine all over me.

## Stanley Park

We walked to Canadian Place which is on the seafront. From there we followed the walk along the sea wall to Stanley Park. On the way we saw lots of sea planes landing and taking off. They also have a Chevron fuel station in the middle of the sea.

We rented cruiser bikes from Spokes bike rental just outside the park and headed into the park. The main cycle loop goes right around the outside of the park and gave us great views of the city and the surrounding areas. After going round the outside we decided to cycle through the woods and got lost before coming to a road where we were pointed in the right direction by another cyclist.

We dropped the bikes off and walked back along the sea wall. On the way we stopped at the Tap and Barrel and had a few beers. I wanted a beef dip sandwich so we booked a table at The Lamplighters Pub in Gastown. 

## Drake at the Fairmont

As we were heading to the restaurant we passed the Fairmont. There were crowds of people standing around the street outside the hotel waiting for someone to show up. We had no idea who we were waiting for but Kirsty was determined to wait and see. After 10 mins and no one showing I eventually convinced Kirsty to move on so we weren't late for our reservation. We later found out it was Drake everyone was waiting for.

## Lamplighters, Gastown

We had dinner at the Lamplighters which was pretty mediocre and then headed back to the hotel.
