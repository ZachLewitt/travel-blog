## The Drive

We woke up early as we had a 6 and a half hour drive ahead of us. It had rained heavily overnight so the smoke in the town had cleared. For the first time we could actually see the mountain range surrounding the town. This was brief however as the clouds quickly moved in and covered them up.

At this point we decided seeing any of Revelstokes natural sights was pretty unlikely and we were better off hitting the road. We jumped in the car and headed down Highway 1.

The route down Highway 1 took us closer towards the Bush Creek fire. As we got closer towards central BC the smoke really picked up. We were forced to detour around Chase and eventually returned to Highway 1 at Kamloops. This town was incredibly smokey and looked like you would need a gas mask to move around. 

Eventually we reached Highway 97 before turning onto Highway 99 also known as the Sea to Sky Highway. This road was very smokey as well, there were a few smaller wildfires burning nearby which were keeping this up. I got the impression this would be a very scenic drive on better days.

As we got to about 100km out of Whistler the smoke started to clear. We got a few great views of lakes and canyons.

## Bear Spotting

I slowed down to cross a bridge and as I was about to speed off I saw a pair of bears in the bushes at the side of the road. They spotted the cars and then quickly dipped back into the bush. I span the car around for a double take. The bears had re-emerged and as we were driving along slowly they seemed pretty unphased. I managed to park up alongside them and Kirsty grabbed a quick video. I didn't hang around for long as we didn't want to disturb them.

## Hortsmans House, Whistler

After a long drive we eventually reached Whistler. Our hotel/apartments were the Hortsmans House. Here we had a full suite to ourselves and also underground private parking which was badly needed in Whistler.

We headed into town for a quick exploration. We were both very impressed by Whistler. The number of bars and restaurants was perfect. The town has a strange vibe feeling very upper class and well kept while also being covered with grubby mountain bikers and hikers (us) everywhere.

After wandering round for a bit we decided we were knackered from a day of driving and decided to head home.
