## Cascade Ponds

We started the day by walking from our hotel to the nearby Cascade ponds. The walk to the ponds took us along the Banff legacy trail where we nearly got ran over by bikes several times and electrified by the electric cattle grids. 

The cascade ponds are near to the larger Lake Minnewanka. By English standards would be classed as a lake. People paddleboard and canoe on the ponds and there is a picnic area were people can eat lunch and BBQ. There are several small islands in the middle of the lake connected by bridges.

## Tunnel Mountain 

After leaving the ponds we headed to Tunnel Mountain. This is a large mountain right next to Banff town centre that offers incredible views of Banff and the surrounding valley.

The walk up Tunnel Mountain was a steep incline lasting 2.4km. The path was pretty busy but easy to traverse. Kirsty powered off ahead and quickly ran out of gas, apparently it's not good etiquette to suggest your wife does more cardio when she gets home.

We eventually reached the peak and the views were stunning. On one side the mountain looks out over Banff and into the valley and the other side looks out over the golf course and river. We stopped for a few photos at the red chair photo spot which looks out over Banff. Kirstys friends came here for their honeymoon and took a photo here so Kirsty wanted to try replicate it.

We sat for lunch at the top of the mountain and enjoyed the view. A squirrel came along and demanded some of my sandwich so I gave him a few bits and then he happily scurried off. After lunch we headed back down the mountain to the car.

## Bow Falls

We took the car back to the hotel and then caught the shuttle into Banff. We walked through Banff town and then headed down the Bow Falls trail to see the waterfalls.

The Bow Falls trail runs through the woods alongside the river. There is an art display in the woods with sculptures crafted by local artists.

The actual falls run as rapids for 500 or so metres and as the reach the bottom turn into a waterfall which then goes back into a gentle river. 

At the bottom of the falls sits the Fairmont hotel which is a grand hotel. We walked up to the hotel restaurant Waldhaus expecting amazing views of the fall but the terrace was unimpressive so we left.

## Earls Kitchen Bar

After the walk we into Banff town for dinner. We stopped at Earls Kitchen/Bar during happy hour. 

The restaurant had a more upclass feel compared to the Brewhouse from the day before (probably because it didn't have 30 TVs on the wall).

The food was great, I had a Hawaiian pizza and a Mango Margarita (much needed after all the walking) and Kirsty had a Wine and Nachos.
