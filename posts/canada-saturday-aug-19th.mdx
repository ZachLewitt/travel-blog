## Maligne Canyon 

We got up early and headed into Jasper National Park. Our first stop was Maligne Canyon. This was a walk following the river through a canyon as it turns into various waterfalls and streams. At various intervals in the walk are 6 bridges which act as good viewpoints to see the waterfalls and the river. The trail was pretty busy but we walked as far as the fifth bridge and then headed back up the trail loop.

## Valley of the Five Lakes 

Our next stop was the Valley of Five Lakes hike. This walk took us through the woods and then around the shores of 5 different lakes. The lakes all had a very interesting emerald green colour to them. We did the short route as the trail was pretty packed.

## Path of the Glacier Trail

The final hike of the day was the Path of the Glacier Trail. This was by far the highlight of the day. This trail was in the Mount Edith Cavell area at the end of Cavell Road. The car park was rammed so we had to hang around for a bit before finding a space. 

Eventually we parked up and headed up the short hike up the hill to the foot of the Glacier. The views here are spectacular. There is a frozen glacier at the top of the mountain running into a waterfall which goes into a bright blue lake. We sat by the lake for a while and watched a few stupid people go into the freezing water. One weird couple crab walked into the water, Kirsty wasn't sure they were actual humans.

## Jasper Pizza Place

After the hike we headed into Jasper for dinner. We ended up at the Jasper Pizza Place. The pizza here was really good. I had the Seven Acres wood fired pizza which had an amazing pesto sauce on the base. Kirsty had the Pasta Alfredo which also looked very tasty.
