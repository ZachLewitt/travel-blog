## Banff Legacy Trail

We caught the 9:10 shuttle into Banff and rented E-bikes from the Adventure Hub on Banff avenue. The town was empty at this time of the morning so we quickly shifted out of the town and onto the Banff legacy trail.

In order to get some exercise we set the bikes on the lowest speed setting and made sure we did some peddling. The trail runs parallel to the freeway but the views of the mountains and lakes are spectacular so you don't acknowledge the noise of traffic. We stopped at the halfway point for views of Mount Rundle.

## Canmore

Eventually we completed the trail and reached Canmore. We walked down the main town strip and went for bagels at the Rocky Mountain Bagel Company which were delicious. I had the Mountaineer with Pastrami and Kirsty had the Vege option.

After our bagels we did a bit of shopping and then jumped back on our bikes. We headed back down the legacy trail but this time we ramped up the speed on our bikes. We were constantly met with disapproving looks from jealous cyclists on non electric bikes as we flew past them.

## Lake Minnewanka 

As we started coming into Banff we took a detour past the Cascade ponds and headed along the road towards Lake Minnewanka. The road took us through the forest and past Two Jack Lake. 

Eventually we reached Lake Minnewanka, a giant lake nestled in the mountains. We parked our bikes up on the beach and had a snack. A bride and groom walked onto the beach for a photoshoot which brought back memories.

Kirstys bike was running low on battery so we decided to call the cycling a day and head back to the hotel to get ready for dinner.

After getting ready we cycled the bike backs to town. Kirstys bike finally ran out of battery from not pedalling all day so we swapped bikes and I pedalled unassisted down Banff Avenue.

## Boston Pizza 

We dropped the bikes off and headed for food at Boston Pizza. I had a 22oz Stella which was bigger than a normal pint, best beer so far. For food I had a meteor pizza and Kirsty had a vege pizza. The pizza was pretty average.
